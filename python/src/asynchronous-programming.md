# Asynchronous Programming

In this article, you will learn how to write asynchronous programs in Python. You will also learn how to use the `asyncio` module to write asynchronous programs.

## What is Asynchronous Programming?

Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows you to write non-blocking code. In asynchronous programming, you can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This is useful if you want to perform long-running tasks without blocking the execution of other tasks.

## How to Write Asynchronous Programs in Python

To write asynchronous programs in Python, you can use the `asyncio` module. The `asyncio` module provides a set of APIs that allow you to write asynchronous programs. The `asyncio` module is part of the Python standard library. You can import the `asyncio` module using the following statement:

```python
import asyncio
```

## How to Create a Task in Python

To create a task in Python, you can use the `asyncio.create_task()` function. The `asyncio.create_task()` function creates a task from a coroutine object. A coroutine object is created using the `async` keyword. You can use the `await` keyword to wait for the result of a coroutine object.

```python
import asyncio
```

```python
async def task():
    print('Hello World')
```

```python
asyncio.create_task(task())
```

```python
asyncio.run(asyncio.sleep(0))
```

## How to Create a Task Using a Lambda Function

You can also create a task using a lambda function. This is useful if you want to pass arguments to the task.

```python
import asyncio
```

```python
asyncio.create_task(lambda: print('Hello World'))
```

```python
asyncio.run(asyncio.sleep(0))
```

## How to Create a Task Using a Class

You can also create a task using a class. This is useful if you want to pass arguments to the task.

```python
import asyncio
```

```python
class MyTask:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    async def __call__(self):
        print('Hello', self.name)
```

```python
asyncio.create_task(MyTask('World'))
```

```python
asyncio.run(asyncio.sleep(0))
```
