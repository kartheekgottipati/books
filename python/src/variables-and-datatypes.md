# Variables and Data Types

Welcome to this chapter on Python variables and data types!. In this chapter, we will focus on two important concepts in Python programming: variables and data types.

Variables are used to store data values and give them a name so that we can refer to them later in our code. In Python, variables are dynamically typed, which means that the data type of a variable can change during the execution of the program.

Data types in Python refer to the classification of data values based on their characteristics. Python supports a variety of data types such as numbers (integers, floats, and complex), strings, and booleans. Understanding data types is important for manipulating data values in a Python program.

- [Data Types](data-types.md)

Throughout this chapter, we will cover the various aspects of variables and data types in Python, including how to declare variables, work with different data types, and use various built-in functions to manipulate data values. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of these fundamental concepts in Python programming, and be well on your way to writing efficient and effective Python code. Let's dive in!
