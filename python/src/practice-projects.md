# Practice Projects

Its always good to practice what you learn. Here are some projects that you can try to build.

## Projects with basic difficulty

- Simple Calculator: Create a command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- Todo List: Build a command-line or graphical todo list application that allows users to add, remove, and view tasks.

- Random Password Generator: Develop a program that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length, complexity, and character sets.

- Text-based Adventure Game: Create a simple text-based adventure game with a story, locations, and items.

- Web Scraper: Write a script that scrapes specific information from a website, such as news headlines or product prices, and displays the results.

## Projects with intermediate difficulty

- File Encryption and Decryption: Develop a program that encrypts and decrypts files using a symmetric encryption algorithm like AES.

- Chat Application: Build a command-line or graphical chat application using sockets or a higher-level library like websockets for real-time communication.

- RESTful API: Create a RESTful API for a simple application, like a blog or a social media platform, using Flask or Django.

- Web Application: Build a web application with user authentication and a database backend, using a web framework like Flask or Django.

- Command-line Tool: Develop a useful command-line tool, like a file organizer or a code formatter, with an intuitive interface and options.

## Projects with advanced difficulty

- Machine Learning: Implement a machine learning model for a specific task, like image recognition or sentiment analysis, using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

- Web Scraping and Data Analysis: Scrape a large dataset from multiple web sources, clean and preprocess the data, and perform an analysis using libraries like pandas and NumPy.

- Full-Stack Web Application: Develop a complete web application with a frontend framework like React or Angular, a backend using Django or Flask, and a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

- IoT Application: Build an IoT application that communicates with sensors or devices using Python on platforms like Raspberry Pi or Arduino.

- Distributed Computing: Create a distributed application that processes large datasets or performs complex calculations across multiple machines or cloud services using libraries like Dask or Apache Spark.
