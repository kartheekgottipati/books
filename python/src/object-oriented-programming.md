# Object-Oriented Programming

Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications. It is a way of thinking about programming, based on real-world entities like `objects`, which have some `data` or `state` and `behavior`, or things the object can do.

In this chapter, we will learn about the following concepts:

- Classes and Objects
- Constructors
- Class and Instance Variables
- Instance Methods
- Class Methods
- Static Methods
- Inheritance
- Method Overriding
- Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction
- Magic Methods
