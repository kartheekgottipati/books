# Data Structures

In this chapter, we will discuss the data structures in Python, including lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, frozensets, bytes and bytearrays. We will explore their characteristics, how they are used, and why they are essential in programming.

The following data structures are mutable which means that they can be changed after they are created. They include:

- [Lists](lists.md)
- [Sets](sets.md)
- [Dictionaries](dictionaries.md)
- [Bytearrays](bytearrays.md)

The following data structures are immutable which means that they cannot be changed after they are created. They include:

- [Tuples](tuples.md)
- [Frozensets](frozensets.md)
- [Bytes](bytes.md)
