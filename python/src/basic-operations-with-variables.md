`*`      | Multiplication | `x * y`
`/`      | Division       | `x / y`
`%`      | Modulus        | `x % y`
`**`     | Exponentiation | `x ** y`
`//`     | Floor division | `x // y`

`>>`     | Signed right shift   | Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off | `a >> 2`

### AND

The `&` operator is used to compare (binary) numbers. The `&` operator sets each bit to `1` if both bits are `1`. The following is an example of the `&` operator in Python:

```python
# AND

```python
# OR
a = 50
b = 25
a | b
```

### XOR

The `^` operator is used to compare (binary) numbers. The `^` operator sets each bit to `1` if only one of two bits is `1`. The following is an example of the `^` operator in Python:

```python
# XOR

```

### NOT

The `~` operator is used to compare (binary) numbers. The `~` operator inverts all the bits. The following is an example of the `~` operator in Python:

```python
# NOT

### Zero fill left shift

The `<<` operator is used to compare (binary) numbers. The `<<` operator shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off. The following is an example of the `<<` operator in Python:

```python
# Zero fill left shift
a = 50
a << 2
```

### Signed right shift

The `>>` operator is used to compare (binary) numbers. The `>>` operator shifts right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off. The following is an example of the `>>` operator in Python:

```python
# Signed right shift
a = 50
a >> 2
```

## Operator Precedence

Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator.

`is`     | Returns `True` if both variables are the same object
`is not` | Returns `True` if both variables are not the same object
`in`     | Returns `True` if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
`not in` | Returns `True` if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object
`not`    | Logical NOT
`and`    | Logical AND

x = 5
y = 10
z = 15
x + y * z
```

```python
# Output
155
```

```python
# Parentheses
(x + y) * z
```

```python
# Output
255
```

```python
x = 2 + 3 * 4
```

```python
# Output
14
```

```python
x = 2 * 3 ** 2
```

```python
# Output
18
```

```python
x = 6 / 2 * 3
```

```python
# Output
9.0
```

```python
x = 10 - 2 + 3
```

```python
# Output
11
```

```python
x = 2 < 3 and 4 < 5 or 6 < 7
```

```python
# Output
True
```

```python
x = 10 + 4 % 3
```

```python
# Output
12
```
